# CRYSTALS COLLECTOR 

To Play:
You will be assigned a random number.
The goal is to reach that random number, and not go over or below. 

Each crystal shown has a hidden value. You will need to click the crystals to add their secret numbers
together, ultimately reaching or going over the random number that was assigned at the beginning. 

If you go over the target number, you lose.
If you land on the target number, you win.
